## Minimize Lateness

For each request $i$, the length(time) is $t_i$, the deadline is $d_i$
$s$ is the start time.
For each request, the start time is the same.

---
Order the  jobs in order of their deadlines<br>
Assume that $d_1\leq d_2\leq ...\leq d_n$<br>
Initially $f = s$<br>
Consider the jobs $i = 1, 2, ..., n$<br>
&emsp;Assign job $i$ to the time interval from $s(i) = f$ to $f(i) = f + t_i$<br>
&emsp;Let $f = f + t_i$<br>
End<br>
Return the set of scheduled intervals $[s(i), f(i)]$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., n$.<br>

**(4.8)** All scheduled with no inversions and no idle time have the same maximum lateness.

**(4.9)** There is an optimal schedule that has no inversions and no idle time.<br>

The proof of it consists of three parts:

(a) $O$ is the optimal schedule, If $O$ has an inversion, then there is a pair of jobs $i$ and
$j$ s.t. $j$ is scheduled immediately after $i$ and has $d_j < d_i$.

(b) After swapping $i$ and $j$ we get a schedule with one less inversion.

(c) The new swapped schedule has a maximum lateness no larger than that of $O$.
