Asking the following questions:

> Can arbitrary instances of problem $Y$ be solved using a polynomial
> number of standard computational steps, plus a polynomial number of 
> calls to a black box that solves problem $X$

If the answer is *yes*, We say $Y\leq_{P}X$, 
we say $Y$ is polynomial-time reducible to $X$, or
$X$ is at least as hard as $Y$

**(8.1)**<br>
Suppose $Y\leq_{P}X$, If $X$ can be solved in polynomial time, then $Y$
can be solved in polynomial time.

**(8.2)**<br>
Suppose $Y\leq_{P}X$, If $Y$ cannot be solved in polynomial time, then
$X$ cannot be solved in polynomial time.

In a graph $G = (V, E)$, we say a set of nodes $S\subseteq V$ is **independent**
if no two nodes in $S$ are joined by an edge.

**The Independent Set Problem**<br>
Given a graph $G$ and a number $k$ , does $G$ contain an independent set of size at least $k$?

Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, we say that a set of nodes $S\subseteq V$ is a **vertex cover**
if every edge $e\isin E$ has at least one end in $S$.

**Vertex Cover Problem**<br>
Given a graph $G$ and a number $k$, does $G$ contain a vertext cover of size at most $k$.

**(8.3)**<br>
Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph, Then $S$ is an independent set iff $V\S$ is a vertex cover.

**Set Cover**

Given a set $U$ of $n$ elements, a collection $S_1, ..., S_m$ of subsets of $U$, and
a number $k$, does there exist a collection of at most $k$ of these sets whose union equals all of $U$

Vertex Cover $\leq_{P}$ Set Cover

**Set Packing Problem**<br>
Given a set $U$ of $n$ elements, a collection $S_1, ..., $S_m$ of subsets of $U$ and a number $k$, 
does there exist a collection of at least $k$ of these sets with the property that no two of them intersect.

Independent Set $\leq_{P}$ Set packing 

**Satisfiability Problem**<br>
A **clause** is simply a disjunction of distinct terms:
$C_i = t_1\vee t_2\vee ... \vee t_l$ <br>

each $t_i \isin \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, \neg{x_1}, ..., \neg{x_n}\}$<br>
If it causes all of the conjuction $C_1\land C_2\land ...\land C_k$ 

**SAT**<br>
Given a set of clauses $C_1, ..., C_k$ over a set of variables $X = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}$
does there exist a satisfying truth assignment?

Given a set of clauses $C_1, ..., C_k$ each of length 3, over a set of variables $X = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}$
does there exist a satisfying truth assignment?
