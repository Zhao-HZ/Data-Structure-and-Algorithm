The input to a computational problem will be encoded as a finite binary string $s$, <br>
We denote the length of a string $s$ by $|s|$.
We identify a decision problem $X$ with <u>the set of strings on which the answer is "yes"</u> <br>
An algorithm $A$ for a decision problem receives an input string $s$ and returns the value "yes" or "no".
<br> We will denote this returned value by $A(s)$.<br>
We say that $A$ solves the problem $X$ if for all strings $s$, we have $A(s)=yes$ iff $s\in X$<br>
$A$ has a **polynomial running time** if there is a polynomial function $p(.)$ so that  for every input string $s$.<br>

We can express $P$ of all problems $X$ for which there exists an algorithm $A$ with polynomial running time
that solves $X$.

Efficient Certification

In order to check a problem, we need the input string $s$ as
well as a seperate "certificate" string $t$ that contains the evidence that
$s$ is a "yes" instance of $X$.

**Efficient Certifier**<br>
- $B$ is a polynomial-time algorithm that takes two input arguments $s$ and $t$.
- There is a polynomial function $p$ so that for every string $s$, we have $s\in X$
iff there exists a string $t$ s.t. $|t|\leq p(|s|)$ and $B(s, t) = yes$

Define $NP$ to be the set of all problems for which there exists an efficient certifier.<br>
